# Israel News Montitoring Dashboard

This repository provides open-source documentation for building news monitoring dashboards designed to track fast-moving geopolitical events in Israel. The dashboards are intended for residents who want to stay informed, particularly during Jewish holidays when many refrain from using electronic devices, focusing on official governmental news channels and public safety alerts.

## Data Sources

See the `data-sources` folder which attaches two informational repositories as submodules. Data is offered without warranty as to its relibility.

- [Public shelter lists](https://github.com/danielrosehill/Public-Shelter-Lists-Israel/tree/bdf68675fa68a70b69436c222b12e6ef59ea801f)
- [News links](https://github.com/danielrosehill/Israeli-News-Links/tree/53875c4b556907b5d8db2b23eed26fe9d64494b0)

**Public shelter links** aggregates municipalities' maps of public shelters (*miklatim*) while **news links** aggregates RSS feeds and other news sources that might provide additional monitoring targets.

## Notes On Copyright

This utility was created for the benefit of English speakers living in Israel and wishing to keep appraised of ongoing geopolitical developments with a "bird's eye" news monitoring type interface. 

Kan (Israel's state broadcaster) is free to air in Israel. The Red Alert system will not display results without an Israeli IP.

If you don't live in Israel and are just interested in following the news - this is not the tool for you!
