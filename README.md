## Purpose Statement

For those staying up to date with developments in Israel during geopolitically sensitive times.

## Notes On Copyright

This utility was created for the benefit of English speakers living in Israel and wishing to keep appraised of ongoing geopolitical developments with a "bird's eye" news monitoring type interface. 

Kan (Israel's state broadcaster) is free to air in Israel. The Red Alert system will not display results without an Israeli IP.

If you don't live in Israel and are just interested in following the news - this is not the tool for you!
